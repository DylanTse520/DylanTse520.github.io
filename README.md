**Project Objective**: We need to create a personal home page for ourselves. This personal homepage would demonstrate who I am personally and professionally. From a personal perspective, people get to know what I like, what I do in my pastime. From a professional perspective, I can show my educational experience and my working experience. I can also show my skills and abilities. This personal homepage can also be a supplementary material to my resume for recruiters who would like to know better about me.
